					When brands are fighting for user’s screen space, we take a creative approach to stand out. Our UI UX design solution is planned to solve the user problem. We categorize it in three major segments - ideation, inspiration, and execution. Unified Infotech’s main tenet is to understand the user behavior and putting ourselves in the end-user situation to manifest all these categories. The result - an unconventional UI and UX design solution that is embraced by end-users.

					Website design creates first impressions in the mind of customers and our aim is to gain their trust on first look. The design of your website is extremely essential to create the first impression in the mind of your customers. It helps you establish your brand image. They always prefer something that is visually pleasing. It helps in gaining customer confidence. A bad design turns your customers away from your website. Design is also essential for proper Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Bad design affects your indexing in major search engines. As your competitors are always focussing on having a good website design, a bad design makes you lose the competitive edge against others.

					An easy interaction between customers and website is essential for having satisfied clients. We try to keep this interaction smooth. Customers always want a website that is fast and easy to navigate. Slow websites or websites that are too complex to navigate will easily frustrate a customer and turn them away. They want everything and they need it quickly, without much difficulty. It may involve gathering information about the company, about any product, user feedback or buying the product and proceed to payment. So it is the responsibility of every business to ensure that their website is well optimized and customer friendly. They should ensure that the customers can quickly find what they are looking for without indulging into any form of complexity in the website.

					We make your brand popular by giving it a prominent presence in the digital ecosystem and hence increase sales volume. Traditional form of print media marketing is slowly losing relevance in today’s digital era. We write emails rather than physical letters through posts. We read e-books rather than physical books. We no longer read paper newspaper. Rather we read news from mobile apps in our tablets. Tabloids and magazines are also most commonly read in tablets now-a-days. The roadside advertisement banners are being replaced by digital banners. Schools, colleges and universities are all taking the digital route for education. Traditional libraries to keep books have been replaced by digital libraries. Huge volumes of every sort of data are stored digitally.
